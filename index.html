           <h2> Ideas for the Future</h2>
           <p> I’ve been thinking about technologies that can improve advertising in the future and here are the ideas that I’ve thinked of:</p>
           <ul>
               <li> A technology that allows the user to test out the product virtually/mentally by sending signals to your brain. People would be able to feel, taste, and use the product in the virtual world. It is something to wear on your head and it can manipulate your brain into thinking that the advertised product is infront of you. This headset can also fidn out want you need by connecting to your brain and send you advertisment of the item you need the most.</li>
               <li> An app that allows the user to see what does the product look on them or in their room/house virtually . It can be used if you want to buy clothing, furniture, declorations, so you're unsure of how the item will look in your house or on you the app can help you by showing you how the furniture and decloration would look in the place you want it to be or how the clothing would look when you wear it. </li>
